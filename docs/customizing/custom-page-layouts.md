# Custom Page Layouts

Page Layouts are regular Angular components. 
There are no restrictions to the content of the Layout components.

Each layout must provide a RouterOutlet with the ID `main-content-outlet`.
That is where the content of the page is projected. 

```html
<router-outlet id="main-content-outlet"></router-outlet>
```

The `@app/sdk` library provides a set of components and services you can use to assemble custom layouts.

## Components

- `<app-toolbar />` - application toolbar
- `<app-sidebar />` - application sidebar
- `<app-title />` - application title

## Services

- Navigation Service
- Preview Service

## Creating Basic Layout

The following structure resembles the `Standard Layout` component coming with the `@app/sdk` library:

```html
<app-toolbar
  [entries]="[/* array of AppToolbarEntry */]"
  (toggleSidebar)="sidebar?.toggle()">
</app-toolbar>

<app-sidebar #sidebar [entries]="[/* array of AppToolbarEntry */]">
  <router-outlet id="main-content-outlet"></router-outlet>
</app-sidebar>
```

If you want to render the runtime set of toolbar buttons, use the `NavigationService` to access all the entries:

```ts
export class MyCustomLayout {
  private navigationService = inject(NavigationService);

  headerEntries$ = this.navigationService.headerEntries$;
  sidebarEntries$ = this.navigationService.sidebarEntries$;
}
```

Next, forward the sidebar and header entries to the corresponding components:

```html
<app-toolbar
  [entries]="headerEntries$ | async"
  (toggleSidebar)="sidebar?.toggle()">
</app-toolbar>

<app-sidebar #sidebar [entries]="sidebarEntries$ | async">
  <router-outlet id="main-content-outlet"></router-outlet>
</app-sidebar>
```

You can modify the entry collections as part of your layout implementation, or plugin requirements.

### Integrating at the  Application Level

```ts
export const appRoutes: Routes = [
  // Using custom layout for all child routes/components
  {
    path: 'pages',
    component: MyCustomLayout,
    children: [
      {
        path: 'page1',
        component: Page1Component
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

### Integrating at the Plugin level

If your plugin provides a nested structure of routes and components,
you can modify the `src/lib/lib.routes.ts` file to set the global layout for all your plugin routes: 

```ts
import { Route } from '@angular/router';

export const myPluginRoutes: Route[] = [
  { 
    path: '/my-plugin', 
    component: MyCustomLayout,
    children: [
      {
        path: '/page1',
        component: MyCustomPlugin
      }
    ]
  }
];
```
